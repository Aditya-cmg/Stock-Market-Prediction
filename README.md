# Stock-Market-Prediction

## Datasets used-
Stock to analyse and predict - SENSEX(S&P BSE SENSEX) <br>
Download historical prices from - https://finance.yahoo.com <br>
Download textual news data from - https://bit.ly/36fFPI6 <br>

in case the download of historical prices is not allowed as found in my system - a code to extract this data aka Web Crawler is also attached.

### Descripton-
Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices amd sentimental analysis of news headlines <br>

the purpose of this notebook is to do basic time series analysis to find out if there is any structure in stock data to exploit and also to do text analysis on news headlines to confirm hypothesis that news/journalist affect stock prices
